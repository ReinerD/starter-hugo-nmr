abstract: 1H-29Si-1H double cross polarization inverse detection (DCPi) solid-state
  NMR, has recently been shown to be a powerful tool for studying molecules adsorbed
  on the silica surface. In this contribution, we develop an improved version (MCPi)
  which incorporates a block of multiple contact pulses, and quantitatively compare
  the sensitivities of MCPi and DCPi over a typical range of experimental parameters.
  The MCPi pulse sequence aims at higher sensitivity and robustness for studying samples
  with various relaxation characteristics. In the case of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
  molecules adsorbed on the silica surface, MCPi performs equally well or up to 2.5
  times better than DCPi over a wide range of parameters. The applicability to and
  performance of MCPi on composite materials was demonstrated using a sample of polymer-silica
  composite, where significantly higher sensitivity could be achieved at very long
  total mixing times. The results also showed that both techniques are surface specific
  in the sense that only the groups close to the surface can be detected.
