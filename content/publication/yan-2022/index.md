abstract: The liquid-solid interface is of great importance in fundamental and applied
  research. However, the in-situ characterization of liquid-solid interfaces is very
  challenging. In this work, we demonstrated that 1H–29Si-1H multiple-contact cross
  polarization with indirect detection (MCPi) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
  (ssNMR) spectroscopy is an excellent tool for studying dehydration and deuterium
  exchange at the solvent-silica interface. The results provided direct evidence that
  the physically adsorbed water molecules present on the silica surface were completely
  removed in the presence of DMSO, while the silanol groups were satisfactorily deuterated
  in the presence of a DMSO-D2O mixture. The knowledge obtained from the 1H–29Si-1H
  MCPi experiment was also extended to the development of an 1H liquid-state NMR-based
  technique for the quantification of moisture and hydroxyls on inorganic and organic
  solids, as an alternative to the conventional thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) but
  with broader applicability. Moreover, this study offers a promising tool for studying
  the challenging questions involving liquid-solid interface.
