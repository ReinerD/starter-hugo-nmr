abstract: Soybean oil (SBO) is a renewable material used as an alternative to conventional
  petroleum-derived oils in the processing of rubber composites. Upon chemical modifications,
  such as epoxidation, its performance in the processing of rubber can be significantly
  improved, as indicated by a considerable reduction of the mixing energy. Although
  it has been hypothesized that hydrogen bonding between functional groups (e.g.,
  epoxy) of SBOs and silanols present on the silica surface plays a key role, there
  is still a lack of direct evidence supporting this hypothesis. In this work, it
  is demonstrated that there is an overall correlation between the epoxy concentration
  of SBOs and the mixing energy, consistent with the long-held hypothesis. In particular,
  a correlation between the SBO-silica adsorption affinity and the degree of epoxidation
  is revealed by a set of surface-selective solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
  (ssNMR) experiments. In addition, the surface-selective ssNMR technique demonstrated
  in this work could also be used to evaluate the adsorption affinity of other oils
  and/or additives more broadly.
