 abstract = {Soybean oil (SBO) is a renewable material used as an alternative to conventional petroleum-derived oils in the processing of rubber composites. Upon chemical modifications, such as epoxidation, its performance in the processing of rubber can be significantly improved, as indicated by a considerable reduction of the mixing energy. Although it has been hypothesized that hydrogen bonding between functional groups (e.g., epoxy) of SBOs and silanols present on the silica surface plays a key role, there is still a lack of direct evidence supporting this hypothesis. In this work, it is demonstrated that there is an overall correlation between the epoxy concentration of SBOs and the mixing energy, consistent with the long-held hypothesis. In particular, a correlation between the SBO-silica adsorption affinity and the degree of epoxidation is revealed by a set of surface-selective solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) experiments. In addition, the surface-selective ssNMR technique demonstrated in this work could also be used to evaluate the adsorption affinity of other oils and/or additives more broadly.},
